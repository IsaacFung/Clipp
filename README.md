# Clipp

Various API and private keys have been deleted since the app is no longer being developed. The src directory contains the frontend code for the various screens and components of the app. The services directory contains most of the code for the backend.

My primary role was developing the frontend and backend of the app's chat and messaging functionality as well as various other frontend components. Most of backend functionality of the app's messaging can be found in services/messaging_services.js. The frontend chat components I built can be found in src/screens/chat_screen.js and src/screens/messaging_screen.js. I also built additional components in other files alongside the rest of the dev team, but the above files are what I wrote end-to-end.
